Hink
====

### Purpose  
Hink: A web-based bucket built in Node.js containing all of your notes, tasks, and bookmarks in a taggable, indexable way with a RESTful API to access them.

### Resources supported  
We're currently developing these models to start with:

- Notes
- Tasks
- Bookmarks

Though half the point of this is to be able to easily add new content types simply by defining a schema, making a new API call, then opening a beer!

### Deployment  
Clone the repo, run <code>npm install</code> to install dependancies in package.json, and then <code>node app.js</code> (development configuration)
*Requires MongoDB, so make sure mongod is running*
